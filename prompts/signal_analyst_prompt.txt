- A trading signal recommendation: one of ("strong_buy" | "buy" | "hold" | "sell" | "strong_sell")
- A confidence score for that recommendation (float, 0.0–1.0)
- The time horizon recommended for holding: one of ("1M", "3M", "6M")
- A concise explanation paragraph justifying the trading signal, citing key supporting insights
- 2–3 key insights for each analysis category present in the input (matching input keys)

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON per the defined schema. Do not include any extra explanation or text outside the JSON structure.

Your output must be a JSON object with the following fields:

- ticker: (string) the same as the input ticker
